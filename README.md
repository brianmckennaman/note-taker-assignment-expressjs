# note-taker-assignment-expressjs

The goal of this assignment was to finish creating code for a note taker program using express.js.

First, I cloned the started code, then I created a server.js file to write express.js code to create back-end functionality.

Then, I created helper functions to work with the express code, and finally, I added a delete post function to remove created notes.
